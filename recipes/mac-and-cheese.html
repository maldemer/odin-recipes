    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="description"><p>This stovetop mac and cheese uses staple ingredients<br>
       and comes together in just 25 minutes. <br>
       This simple recipe is cheap and tasty.</div><p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="ingredients">
       <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
       </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="steps">
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. <br>
            Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start<br>
             on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat <br>
             and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.<br>
             To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. <br>
             Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. <br>
             Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. <br>
             Be careful to not let the milk burn.</li>
        <li>Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! <br>
            Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. <br>
            We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded <br>
            cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. <br>
            Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, <br>
        but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire <br>
        for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe. <br>
        To do so, complete the first three steps above, <br>
        then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, <br>
        Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) <br>
        for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling.</p>
